# Installing Bonsai

The Bonsai editor is currently designed to work with the .NET framework on Windows desktop operating systems, version 7 or later. The easiest way to get started with Bonsai is by downloading the latest installer.

The latest stable release is: **2.8.2 (2.8.2.4463)**

[<i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download Installer (.exe)](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/bonsai/releases/download/2.8.2/Bonsai-2.8.2.exe){class="btn btn-success"}
[<i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download Portable (.zip)](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/bonsai/releases/download/2.8.2/Bonsai.zip){class="btn btn-warning"}

The installer will make sure that .NET and any other required system dependencies for running Bonsai are correctly setup in your computer.
